# Assignment Repository <a href='https://bogaziciai.com//'><img src='media/bogaziciai-logo-sq.png' align="right" height="139" /></a>

This repository will be used to upload and manage assignments
in our lectures.

Each student will work on a branch for each assignment. The assignments
will be commited under the folders named with students' name. After commiting
assignment, a Pull-Request will be sent an a review will be asked.

As the reviewers approve the PR, the assignments could be merged to the
main repository.

#### Create new branch

Create a new branch for each submit, name your branch as
`task{number}-{your_name}`. Replace values in brackets
for your task number and name. Brackets are the convention
to indicate variable, don't use them in your branch.
